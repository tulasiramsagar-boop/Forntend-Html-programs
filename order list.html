        <dl><dt>Html
            <dd>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It provides the basic framework for all web pages and is a foundational technology for front-end development, working alongside Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. 
Core Concepts
Markup Language: HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a web browser. It is not a programming language, but rather a language for describing structure.
Hypertext: This refers to the links that connect web pages to one another, allowing users to navigate between documents and websites seamlessly (e.g., using the <a> tag).</dd>

   <dt>Java
    <dd>Java is a widely used, high-level, object-oriented programming language and computing platform. Originally released by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and now owned by Oracle, it is known for its philosophy of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) due to its cross-platform compatibility. 
Key Features
Platform Independence: Java code is compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode, which can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, without needing recompilation.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Java is built on OOP principles, which promotes modularity, code reusability, and scalability in large applications through concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.</dd>
